////////// PROBLEM 8 //////////
  
/*
  Here we have a for loop that will iterate as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
  What we need to do is console.log(i) so that it logs like so:
    0 second after call - log 0
    1 seconds after call - log 1
    2 seconds after call - log 2
    3 seconds after call - log 3
    4 seconds after call - log 4
    5 seconds after call - log 5

  However, because each call to console.log occurs after the loop has finished, the value of i has changed before the console.log executes.
  We'll need to use a closure to preserve a reference to i at the time of execution.
  
  Fix the code below to log the desired output.
